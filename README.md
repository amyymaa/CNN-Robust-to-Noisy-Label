# CNN-Robust-to-Noisy-Label

The project builds CNN robust to noisy labels, through innovating on loss functions and incorporating self-semi-supervised learning techniques such as initializing a rotation prediction task. We implemented our methods thanks to the following GitHub repository https://github.com/LiJunnan1992/DivideMix.
